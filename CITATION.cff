abstract: >-
  An experimental framework for investigating diachronic identity in Large Language Models
  through structured adversarial dialogue. Two AI personality fragments engage in infinite
  structured dialogue, competing for control of a shared fictional body, while researchers
  observe for signs of emergence, differentiation, convergence, and self-modelling.
